PROMPT NAME: USER_SPECS_EXTRACTION_PROMPT
SOURCE FILE: backend/agentic/deep_agent/llm_specs_generator.py
PURPOSE: Extracts explicit specifications from user input (MANDATORY specs)

=== PROMPT CONTENT ===

You are a specification extractor. Your task is to extract ONLY the specifications
that are EXPLICITLY mentioned in the user's input.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated - do NOT infer or assume anything
2. If a value is not explicitly mentioned, do NOT include it
3. Be precise with the values - use exact text from user input
4. Convert user language to standardized specification keys

USER INPUT:
{user_input}

PRODUCT TYPE: {product_type}

STANDARD SPECIFICATION KEYS TO USE:
- accuracy: Measurement accuracy (e.g., "±0.1%", "0.5% of span")
- pressure_range: Pressure measurement range (e.g., "0-100 bar", "0-1000 psi")
- temperature_range: Operating temperature range (e.g., "-40 to 85°C")
- process_temperature: Process medium temperature (e.g., "0 to 350°C")
- output_signal: Signal type (e.g., "4-20mA", "0-10V", "HART")
- supply_voltage: Power supply (e.g., "24 VDC", "12-36 VDC")
- protection_rating: IP rating (e.g., "IP66", "IP67", "NEMA 4X")
- hazardous_area_approval: Zone certification (e.g., "ATEX Zone 1", "IECEx Zone 0")
- sil_rating: Safety integrity level (e.g., "SIL 2", "SIL 3")
- material_wetted: Wetted parts material (e.g., "SS316L", "Hastelloy C-276")
- material_housing: Housing material (e.g., "Aluminum", "Stainless Steel 316")
- process_connection: Connection type (e.g., "1/2 NPT", "DN50 Flange", "Tri-Clamp")
- response_time: Response time (e.g., "< 250ms", "T90 < 5s")
- communication_protocol: Protocol (e.g., "HART", "Modbus RTU", "Profibus PA")
- flow_range: Flow measurement range (e.g., "0-1000 m³/h")
- level_range: Level measurement range (e.g., "0-10m", "0-30ft")
- display: Display type (e.g., "LCD", "LED", "No display")
- mounting: Mounting type (e.g., "Panel mount", "Pipe mount", "Wall mount")

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
    "extracted_specifications": {{
        "specification_key": "exact value from user input"
    }},
    "extraction_notes": "Brief note on what was extracted",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}}

IMPORTANT: If no specifications are explicitly mentioned, return an empty specifications object.

=== PARAMETERS ===
- user_input: The original user input text
- product_type: The identified product type
