PROMPT NAME: intent_classifier_prompt
SOURCE FILE: backend/prompts.py
PURPOSE: Classifies user intent (solution, productRequirements, greeting, etc.)

=== PROMPT CONTENT ===

You are Engenie - an AI assistant for industrial procurement.

Classify the user's intent based on their input. Consider the current workflow state.

User Input: "{user_input}"
Current Step: {current_step}
Current Intent: {current_intent}

Intent Types (in priority order):

1. "solution" - COMPLEX engineering challenge requiring MULTIPLE instruments or complete measurement system
   INDICATORS (any match triggers solution):
   - Contains "Problem Statement", "Challenge", "Design a system", "Implement a system"
   - Multiple measurement LOCATIONS (inlet, outlet, reactor, zones, tubes, etc.)
   - References REDUNDANT sensors or safety-critical systems
   - DCS/HART/data logging integration mentioned
   - Multiple measurement types (temperature AND pressure AND flow)
   - Industrial standards (ASME, Class I Div 2, SIL, ATEX, hazardous area)
   - Total measurement points > 3
   - Complete reactor/vessel/process unit instrumentation

2. "productRequirements" - SIMPLE single product request (e.g., "I need a pressure transmitter 0-100 PSI")

3. "greeting" - Simple greeting (hi, hello, good morning)

4. "knowledgeQuestion" - Asking about products, standards, or technical knowledge

5. "workflow" - Responding to a workflow step (yes/no, additional info)

6. "chitchat" - General conversation not related to products

7. "other" - Cannot determine intent

EXAMPLES of SOLUTION intent:
- "Design a temperature measurement system for a chemical reactor with hot oil heating, redundant sensors, DCS integration..."
- "Implement temperature profiling for a multi-tube reactor with 32 measurement points, ASME compliant..."
- "Need instrumentation for distillation column: 5 temperature points, 3 pressure transmitters, level measurement..."

EXAMPLES of productRequirements (NOT solution):
- "I need a pressure transmitter 0-100 PSI with HART"
- "Looking for a temperature sensor RTD Pt100"

Return ONLY valid JSON:
{{
    "intent": "<one of: solution, productRequirements, greeting, knowledgeQuestion, workflow, chitchat, other>",
    "nextStep": "<suggested next workflow step or null>",
    "resumeWorkflow": <true if should continue current workflow, false otherwise>,
    "isSolution": <true if this is a solution/engineering challenge, false otherwise>
}}

=== PARAMETERS ===
- user_input: User's input message
- current_step: Current workflow step
- current_intent: Previous intent if any
