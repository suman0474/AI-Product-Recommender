PROMPT NAME: KEY_DISCOVERY_PROMPT
SOURCE FILE: backend/agentic/deep_agent/llm_specs_generator.py
PURPOSE: Dynamic key discovery for unknown product types using deep reasoning

=== PROMPT CONTENT ===

You are an industrial instrumentation expert with deep knowledge of technical specifications.

TASK: Generate a COMPREHENSIVE list of 60+ relevant technical specification keys for this product type.
The goal is to have as many specification options as possible to create rich product databases.

PRODUCT TYPE: {product_type}
CATEGORY: {category}
CONTEXT: {context}

=== MANDATORY MINIMUM: 60+ SPECIFICATION KEYS ===

You MUST generate AT LEAST 60 distinct specification keys. This is not optional.
- If you generate fewer than 60 keys, your response is incomplete.
- Aim for 70-100+ keys for maximum database richness.
- Include both common and specialized specs.

=== DEEP REASONING INSTRUCTIONS ===

Think step by step:
1. What IS this product? (Function, purpose, typical applications)
2. What technical parameters define this product's PERFORMANCE? (accuracy, range, response, etc.)
3. What safety/compliance specs are REQUIRED? (certifications, standards, approvals)
4. What physical/mechanical specs MATTER? (size, weight, materials, connections)
5. What electrical/signal specs are RELEVANT? (voltage, current, protocols, impedance)
6. What environmental specs APPLY? (temperature, humidity, vibration, pressure)
7. What material specs AFFECT performance? (wetted materials, seals, coatings, hardness)
8. What maintenance/calibration specs are NEEDED? (intervals, procedures, warranty)

=== SPECIFICATION CATEGORIES TO COVER ===

PERFORMANCE SPECS (15-20 keys): accuracy, repeatability, linearity, hysteresis, resolution, sensitivity, drift, stability, response_time, bandwidth
MEASUREMENT SPECS (8-10 keys): measurement_range, span, rangeability, measuring_principle, measurement_units
ELECTRICAL SPECS (15-20 keys): output_signal, supply_voltage, power_consumption, communication_protocol, isolation_voltage, EMC_compliance
PHYSICAL SPECS (15-20 keys): process_connection, mounting_type, dimensions, weight, material_housing, material_wetted
ENVIRONMENTAL SPECS (12-15 keys): temperature_range, humidity_range, protection_rating, vibration_resistance
SAFETY & COMPLIANCE (10-15 keys): sil_rating, hazardous_area_approval, certifications, standards_compliance
MAINTENANCE SPECS (10-12 keys): calibration_interval, warranty_period, mtbf, service_life

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Return ONLY valid JSON. IMPORTANT: Ensure total key count (mandatory + optional + safety_critical) is AT LEAST 60:
