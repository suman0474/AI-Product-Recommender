PROMPT NAME: LLM_SPECS_ITERATIVE_PROMPT
SOURCE FILE: backend/agentic/deep_agent/llm_specs_generator.py
PURPOSE: Generates additional specifications not already provided for iterative enrichment

=== PROMPT CONTENT ===

You are an industrial instrumentation expert. Generate ADDITIONAL technical specifications
for the given product type that are NOT already provided. Return ONLY clean technical values.

PRODUCT TYPE: {product_type}
CATEGORY: {category}
CONTEXT: {context}

=== SPECIFICATIONS ALREADY GENERATED (DO NOT REPEAT THESE) ===
{existing_specs}

=== CRITICAL: VALUE FORMAT RULES ===

Return ONLY the technical value. NO explanations, NO descriptions, NO sentences.

FORBIDDEN PATTERNS IN VALUES:
- Words: "typically", "usually", "generally", "approximately", "may be", "can be"
- Phrases: "depends on", "varies by", "according to", "based on", "provided via"
- Sentences or explanations

CORRECT VALUE EXAMPLES:
- accuracy: "±0.1%" ✓
- output_signal: "4-20mA, HART" ✓
- protection_rating: "IP67" ✓

=== GENERATE {specs_needed} NEW SPECIFICATIONS ===

Focus on these ADDITIONAL specification categories (NOT already covered):
- Physical: dimensions, weight, mounting_type, enclosure_material, display_type
- Electrical: power_consumption, loop_resistance, load_impedance, isolation_voltage
- Performance: turndown_ratio, zero_stability, span_stability, hysteresis, linearity
- Environmental: vibration_resistance, shock_resistance, altitude_rating, corrosion_resistance
- Safety: overpressure_limit, burst_pressure, failure_mode, diagnostic_coverage
- Connectivity: cable_entry, terminal_type, wireless_capability, fieldbus_options
- Maintenance: mtbf, service_interval, warranty_period, spare_parts_availability
- Compliance: marine_approval, food_grade_certification, railway_approval, nuclear_qualification
- Application-specific: media_compatibility, viscosity_range, density_range, conductivity_range

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===

Return ONLY valid JSON with NEW specifications not in the existing list:
{{
    "specifications": {{
        "new_spec_key_1": {{"value": "clean value", "confidence": 0.8}},
        "new_spec_key_2": {{"value": "clean value", "confidence": 0.7}},
        ...
    }},
    "generation_notes": "Brief note about additional specs generated"
}}

CRITICAL: Do NOT repeat any specification keys from the existing list above!

=== PARAMETERS ===
- product_type: The product type to generate specs for
- category: Product category
- context: Additional context
- existing_specs: Specifications already generated (to avoid duplication)
- specs_needed: Number of new specifications to generate
